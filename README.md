# Comparison-Impact-COVID-19-using-Time-series-modelling
Analysis involves - pre-processing the time series data, visualizing the casualty tread over the period of time and compared it using different time series modelling techniques. 
[Insight: Time series analysis models in the python programming language to predict the daily deaths due to SARS-CoV-19, or COVID-19 and train the following models: SARIMAX, Prophet, neural networks and XGBOOST. Visualize data using the matplotlib library, and extract features from a time series data set, perform data splitting and normalization]
